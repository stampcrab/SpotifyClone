This is a music catalog app: a clone of the popular Spotify app!
I have created a small slice of the app, as I learn the basics of GraphQL and how to implement a GraphQL server.

This project uses [.NET CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/) and requires .NET 8.0+ runtime. In order to build the project locally, run:

```shell
dotnet build
```

To start the server, from the root directory, run:

```shell script
dotnet watch
```

I am using [Mock Spotify REST API](https://spotify-demo-api-fe224840a08c.herokuapp.com/v1/docs/) for an external data source.
